### Note
1. The number of submissions is limited to five times per day. The highest score among your submissions will be used for evaluation. We will conduct the evaluation once per day between 20:00 and 22:00, starting from April 13, 2025, and ending on April 20, 2025. It is strongly recommended that you submit your results at least once before April 20, 2025, to ensure that your submission is properly received and considered for evaluation.
2. Please visit [EOTGC](https://nlpcc2025eotgc.cubenlp.com) to submit your results. Your submission should be a JSON file formatted according to the specifications in [Guideline](https://github.com/cubenlp/EOTGC-2025NLPCC/blob/main/Task%20Guideline.md).
3. Your submission must include a description of your method (for testing phrase, a simple paragraph is sufficient so that you can focus on optimizing your system). Submissions without this description will not be considered for evaluation.
